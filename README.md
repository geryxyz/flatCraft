# flatCraft
Sample tasks for future Java developers based on Microsoft Minecraft
These sample task uses the general logic of Minecraft to introduce and interest students about software development. During the long term special courses (held by University of Szeged) we are using a Minecraft to illustrate highly abstract concepts like software visualization and software analysis. We are a proud user of [CodeMetropolis](http://codemetropolis.github.io/CodeMetropolis/) software visualization toolkit.

## Levels of difficulty

### Beginner

Tasks for this are contained under `FlatCraftExample` folder. The target audience is primary school children and their parents, who have no or minimal experience in software development. The goal is to introduce fundamental concepts like statement and program code.

### Intermediate

The more challenging task is located in `FlatCraftSheepExample`. We target the later years of primary and the whole duration of secondary schools. These children potentially have several classes on software development in a wide variety of languages. Our primary goal is to introduce the syntax of Java programing language.

### Expert

The folder `FlatCraftPlatformsExample` contains the most difficult tasks. We use them to introduce abstract concepts like software visualization and analysis while providing challenging tasks for those who can write Java programs without supervision.
